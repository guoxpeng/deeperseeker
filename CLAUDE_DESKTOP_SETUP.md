# Setting up deeperseeker in claude desktop
Claude desktop app is available on Linux, MacOS and Windows.
Deeperseeker can be setup on claude desktop app by using it's 3p(third party) mode.

## Setup
For this firstly install claude desktop app from : https://claude.com/download

After this you must have deeperseeker running, claude desktop app needs either endpoint to be running on localhost or must have https support.

In claude desktop click harmburger/three lines menu and click Help->Troubleshooting->Enable Developer Mode

After this claude may take a restart and then again click on harmburger menu and this time you would have developer named menu.
Now click on developer->Configure Third Party Inference and then a popup window will open in which in connection select gateway and in gateway configure the following:

__*Credential Type*__: Static API Key

__*Gateway base URL*__ : http://localhost:4000/ (must be https if not localhost and don't add any /v1,etc)

> **Using DeeperSeeker from another machine?** The gateway URL must be HTTPS.
> Turn on the built-in HTTPS listener — see the "HTTPS" section of the README:
>
> ```bash
> # .env
> HOST=0.0.0.0
> DEEPSEEKER_HTTPS_ENABLED=1
> DEEPSEEKER_HTTPS_PORT=4443
> ```
>
> A self-signed certificate is generated on first start; use
> `https://<host-ip>:4443/` as the gateway base URL. Import the generated
> `tls/self-signed.crt` into your trusted root store to silence the browser
> warning, or point `DEEPSEEKER_HTTPS_CERT` / `DEEPSEEKER_HTTPS_KEY` at your own
> certificate. Remember the certificate's SAN must contain the address you
> actually connect to.

__*Gateway API key*__ : Add your configured API key or default is dseeker

__*Gateway auth scheme*__ : x-api-key/bearer (DeeperSeeker supports both)
Then click test model discovery and test connection if it works then just save and apply.

If it does not then check your ip, port or api key if still not works then feel free to open issue.
